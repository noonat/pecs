magnificent pecs. [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/phuedx/pecs.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/phuedx/pecs)
=================

pecs is a tiny behavior-driven development library for PHP 5.3, a la
[RSpec](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec) or
[JSpec](http://github.com/visionmedia/jspec).

To use the traditional example, it works like this:

    require "lib/pecs.php";
    require "bowling.php";
    
    describe("Bowling", function() {
      it("should score 0 for a gutter game", function() {
        $bowling = new Bowling();
        for ($i=0; $i < 20; $i++) {
          $bowling->hit(0);
        }
        expect($bowling->score)->to_equal(0);
      });
      
      it("should get drinks for free just for being here", function() {
        $bowling = new Bowling();
        expect($bowling->score)->to_equal(42);
      });
    });
    
    \pecs\run();

The output looks something like this:

    $ php test_bowling.php 

    Bowling
    - should score 0 for a gutter game: pass
    - should get drinks for free just for being here: fail	

    FAILURE:
    expected 0 to equal 42
      #0 .../lib/pecs.php(32): pecs\Expect->assert('_equal', Array, true)
      #1 [internal function]: pecs\Expect->__call('to_equal', Array)

      #3 .../lib/pecs.php(221): {closure}()

      #6 .../lib/pecs.php(195): pecs\Suite->run()
      #7 .../lib/pecs.php(262): pecs\Suite->run()
      #8 .../lib/pecs.php(350): pecs\Runner->run(NULL)
      #9 .../test_bowling.php(19): pecs\run()
      #10 {main}

Credit
======

pecs is greatly inspired by [JSpec](http://github.com/visionmedia/jspec)'s
grammar-less syntax, and was written because I don't want to have to switch
gears so much when going between PHP and JSpec testing.

Todo
====

* Add `before` and `after` hooks
* Need to add more matchers
* Need to improve failure output
